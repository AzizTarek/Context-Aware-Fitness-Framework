# Context-Aware Fitness Framework
Developed a sophisticated framework that seamlessly operates in the 
background of mobile phones, utilizing Kotlin and various APIs 
(OpenWeather, AirPollution, Sleep, etc.). This intelligent system reads the 
user's current context and encourages a healthier lifestyle by offering realtime insights and suggestions. The goal is to motivate users to walk more 
frequently, blending technology with well-being.
